How to install the mod

Like most other Battle Brothers mods, just download the .zip file and place it in the Battle Brothers/data/ folder. Do not unzip the contents of the file, keep them as a zip. If you’ve got the game on Steam, you can right-click it in the library and go to manage -> browse local files to quickly find the install location.
You’ll also need the ‘modding script hooks’ mod, found here:
https://www.nexusmods.com/battlebrothers/mods/42
Furthermore, you’ll need at least the Blazing Deserts DLC, and probably some of the other major ones.



How to build your first base
To be able to build your first base, you’ll need to open the retinue menu. You’ll find the icon of a stronghold in the top right. Click on it.

You’ll be greeted by an overview page, giving you some information about the requirements and uses.

A fulfilled requirement will have a green font, a missing one a red font. Being able to build a port is not a requirement.
To build your first base, you’ll need to upgrade the donkey in the retinue menu to at least a cart. You’ll also need over 500 renown, a number of coins, can’t be on an occupied tile (with a town or other things on it, and you can’t have an active contract. 
If you fulfill all the requirements, you’ll be able to click the Yes button:


After accepting, your new base will appear at your current location. You’ll also get a contract, which states that enemies will attack you. These enemies hail from the closest lair or settlement to your base. Nobles are included, unless you have more than 70 relation with them. A small band of mercenaries will spawn to assist you in the battle, and wait for the enemies at your base.


Make sure to meet the attackers around your base, so that the mercenaries can join you, and you’ll be fighting on a special terrain.
Once all attacks have been repelled, your base is now completed.

Buildings, Attachments and Upgrades

The Warehouse Building
The warehouse building replaces the recruitment building in normal settlements. Here, you can store items, free of charge. Free items will also appear here.
You will continuously obtain tools (9 per day), medicine (7 per day) and ammo (20 per day) per upgrade level (1 - 2 - 3). These numbers can be increased with the right attached locations, more on that later.


The Management Building
To access the management options of your base, you need to click on the fortified building in the background:

You’ll see a number of options. The number of options will increase as you upgrade your base. 



Upgrading:
There are two additional upgrade levels available. To be able to upgrade to the next level, you will also need to upgrade your cart to a wagon or large wagon. Upgrading also costs crowns, and will once again cause enemies to attack. The first upgrade causes two attacks, the second upgrade three attacks, spread over 2 - 3 days. Each further attack will be more difficult than the last. While upgrading, most other functions of your base will be disabled.

Buildings:
You can spend crowns to add buildings to your base. At first, you’ll only have three slots. One of them is occupied with a tavern by default, which you can remove once all the slots are occupied. Upgrading adds one slot per level. 
You’ll be able to build a port, connecting you to other ports, if you’ve built close to the ocean. 
The arena will be available once you’ve upgraded your base to a Stronghold.
The taxidermist will consider the items in your Warehouse when crafting items.

Attached locations:
You can also add locations to your base. These give various buffs to your base and company.

Workshop: 
Generates 1 extra toolset every day. Also increases the amount of tools that can be stored by 2.

Ore Smelter: 
You can now reforge named items to reroll their stats. You’ll need to put them in the stash of the warehouse building, and shift-rightclick on them. This will cost 1.5 times the base value of the item.
Also increases the amount of items the local weaponsmith can carry.

Blast Furnace:  
This gives a 30% discount to instant repairing items at the armorsmith.
Also increases the amount of items the local armorsmith can carry.

Stone Watchtower:
Reveals units around your base through fog of war at all times. 
Also increases Movementspeed and Sight Range of your party when around your base. The movementspeed buff is equal to the bonus the Scout gives, and also stacks with it.

Militia Trainingcamp: 
Gives experience to recruits stored in your base. 200 exp are generated per militia trainingcamp, and this amount is divided by all stored brothers below level 8.
Units spawned by your base, so Guards, Patrols, Caravans and Hired Mercenaries, generate with stronger parties.
Also increases the number of recruits available in your Hamlet, more on that later.
You can build up to three Milita Trainingcamps.

Wheat Fields: 
You don't consume food when around your base.

Herbalists Grove: 
Increases hitpoint regeneration of your wounded brothers by 40% when around your base.
Also generates 1 unit of medicine per day, and allows your warehouse to store 2 more.

Gold Mine: 
Generates gold, to the tune of 150 gold every three days.

Storing and retrieving brothers:
You can store brothers in your base. They will wait for your return, while only demanding half their usual wage. They will not help in any way, and will not get experience from battles. 

Removing your base:
You can elect to remove your base. This is only useful if you want to build it at another spot. All the attached locations will be destroyed, all the buildings lost. Should you forget to retrieve brothers, then they will be available in the next base your build.


Building roads: Starting at the second level of your base, you can build roads to other settlements. You’ll see a number of options, depending on how many unconnected settlements are nearby. The price depends on the amount of road tiles that have to be built. Once you’ve built a road to another settlement, these mechanics will be unlocked:

Patrols: Your base will send out mercenary patrols to friendly settlements. 

Caravans: Other factions that you’re friendly with can send caravans to your base. This will give your base a buff to the inventories of stores, amounting to 5% extra items. Furthermore, your base will also send out caravans to other settlements. They will gather food items produced by the town, and return to deposit it in your storage. If the town does not produce any specific food items, it will still fetch bread and grains.

Sending Gifts: Once you’ve connected your base to other settlements, you can send gifts to noble factions. This requires treasures in your inventory or the storage of the base. The items will be loaded on a caravan, which will set out towards the faction of choice. Once it’s arrived, an event will tell you about the reputation you’ve gained. It is equal to 5% of the market value of the treasures.

The Hamlet: Once your base has reached the final level, you can elect to build a Hamlet. This is a small town connected to it, which houses civilians. In this, you can add some more buildings, and recruit units. Most backgrounds in the game will randomly appear, except for origin-specific, event-specific and useless ones.


Other Features:


Building additional bases:
You can build multiple bases. Each one requires more renown than the last:
        1st Base:  500,
       2nd Base: 1500,
       3rd Base:  3000,
4th Base:  5000,
        …
       Last Base: 15000

The contracts:
After leveling up your base to a Stronghold (level 3), three contracts will be made available. These feature tough battles, they are to be considered endgame content. After completing each contract, a specific feature will be unlocked.
Free the mercenaries: After completing this contract, you will be able to hire mercenaries to follow you around. These mercenaries will stay for a week, and join you in battles (excluded: legendary locations). 
Buy water of life: You will be able to buy a water of life for 20000 crowns. With this, you can heal brothers of permanent wounds.
Recruit the trainer: A special training regimen will be made available. Like the training hall, it lasts for a specific amount of battles, and boosts exp gained by 50%. This allows you to easily level up brothers in the endgame.

The boon:

As the owner of the base, you will get good trade deals and merchants will be willing to carry more items than usual. This is represented via the permanent settlement situation. This buff scales by size:
Tier 1: 4% more items (and more named items), no changes to prices
Tier 2: 8% more items, 5% cheaper items and 5% buff to selling price
Tier 2: 12% more items, 10% cheaper items and 10% buff to selling price

Guards: Your base will naturally hire mercenaries to defend it. They will spawn once a week, and patrol around your attached locations. They will attack enemy parties, and will join you in fights close to them. They won’t stray too far from the base. 

Renaming your base: Click on the name in the town menu to rename your base.


5) Customising your experience
You can find a file called stronghold_settings in the root folder of the .zip file. This file has a number of settings that you can change to customise your experience.

6) For modders
I have put many of the important variables into files in the /!mods_preload/ folder to simplify the process of adding new features. You can write me on Nexus on Discord if you think another setting should be extracted.


That’s it! If you need clarification or think that this guide lacks things, write to me on Nexus or Discord. Thanks for playing.
